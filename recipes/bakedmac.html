    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mac and cheese for one is quick and easy to prepare. Once you try this homemade mac and cheese, you'll never want the boxed stuff again. I cook mine in a soup crock.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons uncooked macaroni pasta</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat 2 pie plates with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Place ground beef, onion, and garlic in a skillet over medium heat. Cook until beef is evenly browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Season beef with chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Lay one tortilla in each pie plate, and cover with a layer of refried beans. Spread 1/2 of the seasoned ground beef over each one, and then cover with a second tortilla. Bake in the preheated oven until tortillas are crisp, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pizzas from the oven and set aside to cool slightly. Then spread 1/2 of the salsa over each top tortilla. Cover each pizza with 1/2 of the Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. Place 1/2 of the tomatoes, 1/2 of the green onions, and 1/2 of the jalapeño slices onto each one.</li>
        <li>Return pizzas to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 to 10 more minutes. Let pizzas cool slightly before slicing each one into 4 pieces.</li>
    </ol>
